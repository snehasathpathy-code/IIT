					<h2 style=color:#090b85; >A little bit about me:</h2>
			<p> I am a girl of Indian origin, brought up in New Zealand and then moved to Brisbane, Queensland which is where my family decided to settle down. I completed most of my foundational academic years in Brisbane and completed Bachelor of Justice from Queensland University of Technology and Advanced Diploma in Business Management. Later I moved to Melbourne for further career advancement and ending up staying here for good.
			<br>
			<p>Today I am dedicated wife and mother, a full-time corporate woman working at the Department of Premier and Cabinet (VIC) within the IT Division. And just before I stopped to realise for a second that being a mother of two small children was in itself a full-time job , I thought I’d take one step further and challenge myself by enrolling back to university. So here I am back at university, and this is one first semester studying a Bachelors in Information Technology.

			<p>
			<p>If and when I am free, I enjoy painting and doing my own DIY creative art projects, singing and dancing, listening to music. I am also a travel enthusiast, and if I had the choice and a bag full of money I would hop on a flight and travel any day and so far, I’ve visited 36 countries.

			<br>
			<P>The artwork shown above are a few pieces I have recently created. I love experimenting and trying different forms of artwork, whether it be abstract oil painting, playing around with water colours (like the piece with the Indian ancient dancer posing) and recently trying out mandala bottle paint work. Art is my means of relaxing and destressing.
			<br>
			<p>If your thinking in your head “isn’t that all a bit too much”, the answer is “it sure is”… But truth be said I like testing my limit and setting personal challenges. I believe when you are doing something in life that your passionate about, it is not seen as a task but rather an opportunity to learn and grow.
