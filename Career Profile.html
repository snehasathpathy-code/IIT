					<h2 style=color:#090b85; >Why IT? What interests me...</h2>
			<p>IT has somewhat always been a big part of my life. My dad is an IT university lecturer and while growing up he always thought it was fun opening the motherboard playing with different parts of the machine. yea I know right :) So thereafter I went to study Bachelor of Justice at Queensland University of Technology but when I met my husband was when the field of Information Technology was truly reintroduced into my life as he owns a Optus Business Centre which is all about serving telecommunications needs to businesses. I have been involved in our family business and learnt that IT has many facets and various paths to career paths to choose from.
			<br>
			<p>I have always been interested in Counter Terrorism and there seems to be a growing threat of Cyber Security within the world we live in today. this is what drew me towards this course, however I am also passionate about Web Design and Application Coding as they are now more relevant than ever before. 
			<br>
			<p>I now work within the IT division of the Department of Premier and Cabinet (Victoria) as a Digital Technical Support Specialist. My role at the department has grown my interest further in the technology field. I have become fond of testing as aspire to either become a Software Tester or pursue a career in Cyber Security.
			<br>
			<p>Aside from the reasons outlined above, another key reason for my decision to change my link of work was to be able to balance my work and family life commitments for the future. Information Technology as an industry is more flexible in terms of work arrangements and being able to work remotely from anywhere when needed. Since working in the IT division especially since the beginning of March when the COVID19 pandemic began nearly my entire department was immediately directed to work remotely from home as this provision was already in place as part of business operations plan. Our work devices were already effectively set up for us to move our work entirely working from our laptops. Working in the IT field, supports working mothers like myself to play their part as a corporate professional and as the same time being able to balance other aspects of life like motherhood.
			</p>
			
				<h3 style=color:#090b85; >Why did I choose to study at RMIT?</h3>
			<P>In my daily life I play multiple roles (the corporate professional, a mother of two little children, the wife and now the student) juggling multiple tasks on any given day, which is why I am strained with the availability of my time. For a while I have been wanting to go back to studies but because the various commitments I have, I don’t have surplus time to physically go in and attend a class or a two hour lecture within a tight structured timetable. I choose to come study at RMIT through Open Universities Australia as it has given me the flexibility to study online, completing assessments and me the time required to travel.
			<br>
			<p>What I have really enjoyed through the progression of this online course is that it doesn’t miss out on the interaction between students, peers and the faculty staff which you generally would have in the traditional online model  of study. I have already made friends who I can turn to when I am unable to understand concepts
</p>
			
			<h3 style=color:#090b85; >What do I expect to learn during the course of my studies?</h3>
			<P>From this degree I expect to gain a combination of knowledge and practical skills to be able to influence and make a mark/ contribution to an organisation’s technological infrastructure and their clients to ensure they are satisfied. I hope to be able to learn the skills needed to come up to Industry standards where I will be able to solve, support, troubleshoot and design things from websites to applications of programming, networks for businesses.
