			<p>The project I have in mind is to create a marketplace flatform website application which is aimed towards facilitating a freelancing online shop that will provide customers the opportunity within a given location to post services or skills either which they have; or post tasks they are looking to get done. It will be a community-based marketplace for people and businesses to outsource tasks, find local services, or to hire flexible staff online or via a mobile app within minutes..
			<br>
			<P><u>Motivation:</u> The modern way of life comes with pressures like having to meet tight schedules aligned with financial constraints. Being a busy mum myself, I don’t have the time to run around making calls to get work done when I know I have a budget in mind or need work completed within a specified time frame. For example, I need to get my resume updated immediately as I want to apply for a job which closes within the next two days. But I am also mindful of (a) spending an awful lot of money and (b) the work of high quality. What do I do? I personally would not know where to start searching. My best options would be to turn to Google to look for companies who provide such services but realistically speaking I would be in a whole lot of dilemma when assessing whether my money is well spent. Outsourcing services has become a norm of conducting business in today’s world, and it is for this very reason that I am wanting to develop a web application which caters to both clients and freelancers..
			<br>
			<p><u>Description:</u> This application will be very useful and will help ease the hassle of people running around getting quotes to compare and make an assessment. The name I have come up with for my web application is TradeServicesSeeker.com. This process generally wastes time and you still many a times are left unaware before they company or individual is accredited or whether their work meets the benchmark. TradeServicesSeeker will connect customers with experts - specifically within the home improvement and services market. Customers just answer a few simple questions about the job they're hoping to get done, await quotes from a range of business, sole traders or even a person who is looking for a quick few hours of work (depending on the task) and then decide who they would like to hire after comparing quotes, business profiles, and reviews. Freelancers or businesses look browse through jobs that have been posted and are interested in working.  If they come across a job that is suitable, and the client’s budget matches their expectations, they can comment on the post, ask further questions, negotiate terms, place a bid, and wait to see if the client accepts the bid offer. Once the bid offer has been accepted, both parties can then exchange contacts details to proceed further to get the task completed.
			<br>
			<p>TradeServicesSeeker will only make their commission for their services once the job has been completed. However, upon commencement of the job there is a certain standard timeframe by which the job must be completed. For example, if the task like lawn mowing has been scheduled to be done today and there is nothing further holding off on making the final payment then the payment must be made within 7 working days. It is important to keep in mind though, when the job is booked and a customer chooses a service provider, the amount payable will be on hold which can be seen on their bank statement. Once the job has been completed and payment has been released by the customer, this payment will go through and show up as a completed transaction on their bank statement.
			<br>
			<P>Once the job has been completed, both parties will receive a review link which is where they have the opportunity to discuss the quality of service which they received, level of customer service, and requested to rate the service provide/customer. The more tasks the person doing the job has completed, the more ratings they build for them enhancing work credibility. These ratings, along with the submitted list of credentials and qualifications establishes TradeServicesSeeker recommended service providers.
			<br>
			<p>A large range of task categories will be provided, where users can use to post a job offered or alternatively post a skill set service (e.g. someone a tutor teaching programming languages, and sets his rate) they want to provide. Tasks can range anywhere from nanny services, tutoring, furniture assembly, cleaning, event staffing, delivery, handyman work.
			<br>
			<p><u>Tools and Technologies:</u> Marketplace apps are high in demand, with industry market leaders like Amazon, Etsy, eBay, Airbnb, Uber, and Groupon who all use their platform to connect various businesses. Keeping this in mind, several marketing concepts/strategies need to be consideration: B2B (business to business), B2C (business to customer), and C2C (customer to customer), web solutions with UI and UX.  A successful marketplace will be based on scalability, execution, performance, and design.
			<br>
			<p>One of the key factors to be mindful of is the role of the marketplace as a mediator. Online marketplaces bridge the gap between sellers and buyers, which is why it is of prime importance to provide effective working cooperation while connecting the buyer and seller.
			<br>
			<p>Building a marketplace will be a time-consuming exercise because the process of development implies coding, quality testing, and fail-free launch. But in the long run, it will be a reliable solution enabling the end user to get tailored functionality and integrations. 
			<br>
			<p>For the success of the service web application, end-to-end development from discovery and concept creation, deep research to development in iterative processes, all need to employed as part of the full cycle development process. We will need to practice client-oriented approach with working by Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) to create custom software meeting industry demands. Collaborating effectively is another core value we stick to. Under one roof, there are best experts including DevOps engineers whose high professional level ensures that the customers get development service delivered on time and without fail.
			<br>
			<p>Overall, if this app is successful, then this development will be leading side by side with market leaders like UberEATS where we are easily and conveniently about to connect people and make getting work done in a fast and economical way. We have already seen Facebook marketplace make a drastic way in the way people shop today, this will be the next level where people no longer will go back to directories to source work they need to get done.
